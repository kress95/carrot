Lex rules:

  ;   - comment, closed by a newline
  \   - string escape
  #   - comment form
(   ) - usual form
{   } - form for map-like tables
[   ] - form for list-like tables
'   ' - form for strings
"   " - also a form for strings

Anything not found in the list is tagged as a literal. (I'm a lazy bum)
